# Express-React-Node Boilerplate
This is a barebones boilerplate for starting an [Express](http://expressjs.com/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), and [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) app. It also include [React Router Dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom). It does not include any paricular database ORM or ODM.


## Setup
To get this boilerplate up and running run ``yarn install`` in both the ``client`` and ``server`` directories to install all dependencies.

## Run
To run the app move to the ``client`` directory and run ``yarn start``, you should now see "Hello World" at http://localhost/3000.
